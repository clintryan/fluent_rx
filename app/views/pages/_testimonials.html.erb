            <p>"Clint is the best teacher that I have ever met. I have been preparing my graduate school application, including the Statement of Purpose. Clint kindly reviewed all the documents with me during the preparation and provided many professional suggestions. He also spent his own time going through it. My application materials look much better after his edits. Clint will be the most significant contributor if I am enrolled in my dream school."</p>

            <p>"Clint is both an easy-going and organized teacher. He reached out to me before classes to understand my goals, and provided after-class comments. What I like the most about Clint is that he prepares his own, original course materials. Most of these materials are business-related. I think he's the only teacher on Amazing Talker that does this. And I can tell immediately when I saw the slides that he spent quite a lot of efforts on them. For people who are in the business/financial field, or for those who are interested in these topics, Clint will be a very good teacher for you."</p>

            <p>"Clint是非常好的老師，尤其適合職場上班族。Clint的上課教材有商用英語，也有case study(我個人蠻喜歡case study)，但如果學生有個別職場英文需求，Clint也很願意配合，且會為學生找出實用的學習方式。我曾經請Clint協助我練習工作上的英文報告、面試或是國外留學事宜，Clint在商業英文的專業，對我幫助真的很大。而在上課的過程中，我也深深感受到Clint希望自己的課程可以真正幫助學生在職涯上成長，也希望學生在短短的上課時間可以有效學習，是位教學很實在的老師～～很用心的老師～～"</p>
